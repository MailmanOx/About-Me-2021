    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">Hi! I'm Liam. I am from Tennessee and I am 15 years old, and my pronouns are he/him. Thank you for visiting my website! Here you can find information about who I am, what I'm passionate about, and what I plan to do in the future as well as fun information like quotes I've come up with and a list of my favorite things.<p>

  <p class="intro">  I am very interested in all things to do with computers and music, and I love to travel. I actually plan on living in a small Municipality  in Norway called Tromsø. There, I hope to become a music producer, even if it means working remotely, which is actually something I prefer. During the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, I had to do my school assignments from home, and that was something I absolutely loved. </p>
