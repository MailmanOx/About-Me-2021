    <p class="intro">From a young age, possibly 7 years old, I have been exposed to technology, and I instantly fell in love. My life revolves around technology. They say that if you work a job you love that you'll never work a day in your life. If I worked a job involving computing, it would feel as though I would never work a day in my life.</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>

    <p class="intro"> Although I don't have any experience with creating music, it is something I am open to learning. I would love to play a synthesizer whether it be digital or analogue. Daft Punk is one of my biggest inspirations and the reason I want to create music some day.
